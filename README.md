# SolvEdge App

PoseTrack is an Android application that uses real-time camera input and machine learning to track elbow movement for physiotherapy exercises. The app leverages **MediaPipe Pose**, **CameraX**, and a custom **Node.js + PostgreSQL backend** to log session data with angle-specific image snapshots and time tracking.

## Key Features

- **Elbow Pose Detection** (left/right) using MediaPipe's heavy model
- **Live Angle Tracking** with overlay visualization
- **Automatic Snapshot Capture** at 135Â°, 90Â°, and 45Â°
- **Time Taken Logging** for each target angle
- **Video Recording** of each session
- **Session Summary Screen** with video and snapshot cards
- **Cloudinary Upload** for snapshot images
- **Backend Integration** (Node.js + PostgreSQL on Render)

## How It Works

1. Launch the app and tap **Start Session**.
2. Choose which joints (elbows) you want to track.
3. The app detects pose in real-time, captures snapshot when a target angle is reached.
4. Once done, click **End Session** to stop recording and upload logs.
5. View session data (video, joint angle, time, snapshot) on a summary screen.
